## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Local Storage for saving data and toggle dark mode
- JavaScript filter property
- [React-beautiful-DnD](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - for reordering list data
- React Context API - Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-uuid) - for generating list item id
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React hooks
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to reorder list items. For that I used React beautiful DnD. It's quite simple and fun

### Continued development

I will focus react custom hooks in future projects. Hooks are more clean and simple. And also I will use uuid for generating ID's. It's comfortable and safer than other methods.

### Useful resources

- [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd) - This helped me how to use react beautiful DnD. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [github-issiue-page](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/issues/192) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand react beautiful DnD draggable component behavior. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
